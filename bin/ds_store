# If you or your server admin become frustrated by the seemingly
# endless creation of these files, there is a quick and easy way
# to turn off the creation of .DS_Store files--execute
# the following command in Terminal:

[ "$1" == "disable" ] && {
    echo "Disabling creation of .DS_Store folder metadata"
    defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true
    defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteUSBStores -bool true
    echo "To disable MDS on a specific volume, execute the following:"
    echo "sudo touch /Volumes/{drive name}/.metadata_never_index"
    echo "Reboot system to take effect"
    exit 0
}

# After the command is executed, reboot your Mac, and you'll be
# good to go--no more .DS_Store files gunking up your system's folders.
# If you need to set certain folders a particular way and want to reenable
# the creation of these files, the fix is just as simple--enter the command
# below and reboot your system once it's executed:

[ "$1" == "enable" ] && {
    echo "Enabling creation of .DS_Store folder metadata"
    defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores false
    defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteUSBStores -bool false
    echo "To enable MDS on a specific volume, execute the following:"
    echo "sudo rm -f /Volumes/{drive name}/.metadata_never_index"
    echo "Reboot system to take effect"
    exit 0
}

echo "Unrecognized argument(s): ds_store $*"
echo "Usage: ds_store [enable|disable]"
exit 1
